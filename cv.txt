ACADEMIC & RESEARCH EXPERIENCE


-   Fieldwork co-ordinator - University of Edinburgh - May-Jun 2017 -
    Dr. Edward Mitchard
    -   Managed the fieldwork of a US Forest Service long term
        experiment in the remote and logistically challenging Bateke
        Plateau region of the Republic of Congo. I supervised the work
        of three students from Marien Ngouabi University, Brazzaville
        for three weeks. I also co-ordinated the work of 8-10
        maintenance workers responsible for creating firebreaks around
        field sites. Fieldwork involved full growth and mortality tree
        censuses in 25 ha plots, followed by controlled burning of the
        plots.
-   Research assistant - University of Exeter - Sep-Dec 2016 - Dr. Lucy
    Rowland
    -   Part of an 8 person research team with 6 weeks fieldwork at the
        Caxiuana Esecaflor drought experiment. Extensive work with
        Li-COR 6400XT Portable Photosynthesis System, collection and
        subsequent analysis of leaf traits. Lab-work at the University
        of Exeter included use of CAN-EYE Leaf Area Index analysis
        software and developing a method for the analysis of foliar
        fungal infections.
-   Field assistant - University of Edinburgh - Mar-Aug 2016 - Dr. Isla
    Myers-Smith
    -   Part of a 4 person field team with 2 months fieldwork at Kluane
        Lake Research Station and Herschel Island (Qikiqtaruk) in the
        Yukon Territory, Canada. I conducted an experiment investigating
        elevation-dependent patterns of seed herbivory, the data from
        which form part of a larger latitudinal study. Other work
        included the collection of a multitude of plant traits,
        ecological monitoring of vegetation cover, and investigating
        soil decomposition rates following the protocol of the
        International Tea Bag Index.
-   Field and lab assistant - University of Edinburgh - Jul-Sep 2015 -
    Jan-Mar 2017 - Dr. Pippa Stone
    -   Part of a 5 person field team for 2 months in Manu National
        Park, Peru. Work included physiological and morphological
        measurements of seedling and adult tree species both in the
        field and in rudimentary field laboratories, as well as
        competition measurements for which I designed and executed the
        methodology. Experience using a MINIPAM-II portable chlorophyll
        fluorescence meter. In 2017 I conducted soil analysis for
        organic carbon, nitrogen content.
-   Field assistant and data analyst - Centre for Ecology & Hydrology -
    May-Dec 2015 - Dr. Stephen Cavers
    -   Designed and executed a methodology to estimate relative damage
        of the Pine Weevil (_Hylobius abietis_) in Scottish Scots Pine
        (_Pinus sylvestris_) populations. The data complements a larger
        reciprocal transplant experiment.



TEACHING & OUTREACH EXPERIENCE


-   Web developer for SEOSAW - Oct 2017-Present
    -   I designed and currently maintain the website for the SEOSAW
        network (Socio-ecological Observatory for Southern African
        Woodlands), using Jekyll, Bitbucket Pipelines, and Github-Pages.
        Notably, I implemented an interactive Javascript leaflet map of
        study sites, using geoJSON data compiled from the SEOSAW dataset
        using R. (seosaw.github.io).
-   Copywriter for _Agricology_ sustainable farming magazine - Jan
    2017-May 2019
    -   Part of a team of seven, writing summaries of online resources
        on the Agricology website. I write approximately two articles
        per month when requested, with a particular focus on soil
        enrichment and pollinator services. This work has given me
        valuable experience in writing for an informed but non-academic
        audience, as the websites target audience is farmers.
        Additionally, I have gained experience in working remotely,
        taking advantage of version control software for effective
        editing. (agricology.co.uk).
-   Co-founder, tutorial designer, tutor for coding proficiency
    initiative (Coding Club) - University of Edinburgh - Oct
    2016-Present
    -   Founding member of team which set up a peer-to-peer learning
        environment for students and staff to overcome statistics
        anxiety and provide training in useful programming skills for
        the biological and environmental sciences. Key duties include
        creating online tutorials using Markdown and HTML, delivering
        tutorials to classes of up to 30 students/staff. Focusses
        include Shiny Web-Applications, hierarchical modelling,
        reproducible research using R Markdown. In 2017, Coding Club ran
        a workshop at the SEECC conference in Aberdeen on manipulating
        big data, attended by ~25 people. In December 2017, Coding Club
        delivered a workshop at the British Ecology Society Annual
        Meeting in Ghent. (ourcodingclub.github.io).
-   Interpretation resources designer - Midlothian Ranger Service - Sep
    2015-Apr 2016
    -   I designed an interpretation panel to be installed in Roslin
        Glen, a Midlothian Country Park. The panel demonstrates the
        historical land use of the glen and the resulting landscape
        features. I also designed a series of factsheets for use in
        secondary schools and a QR code walking route with more
        information. I presented to Lothian Conservation Volunteers and
        Friends of Roslin Glen to secure £1400 to manufacture the
        product and procure licenses.

Foraging Chicken of the Woods - [2018-08-25]
==============================================

I finally found a chicken of the woods mushroom (_Laetiporus
sulphureus_) and had the time and facilities to harvest some and cook
it. I’ve seen lots of chicken of the woods in the past, but have always
been too busy or have been travelling, so haven’t been able to cook it.

I tried a little bit of it first, fried in butter, to see if it made me
feel sick as I’ve heard that it makes some people nauseous. I think I’ll
fry the rest of it to be made into breakfast sandwiches, with lettuce,
tomatoes and mayonnaise. It really does taste like chicken, very lemony
sweet chicken, very tasty.

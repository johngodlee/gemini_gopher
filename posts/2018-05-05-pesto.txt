It was the Dirty Weekendersâ€™ annual charity ceilidh last Thursday,
and there was a raffle to raise money for the Scottish Wildlife
Trust, so I decided to make some pesto as a raffle prize. I got all
the leafy ingredients from Roslin Glen, which is a Dirty Weekenders
project location, and one of my favourite places in the world.

I collected Allium ursinum (Ramsons), Allium paradoxum (Few-flowered
Leek), and Allaria petiolata (Garlic Mustard), all of which are
really easy to identify and in full growth at the moment (late
April). I used the following recipe:

    # Ingredients

    * 100 g garlicky leaves
    * 50g Parmesan grated
    * 50g pine nuts, toasted
    * Olive oil
    * Lemon juice, to taste
    * Salt & pepper

    # Method

    1. Blitz all of the leaves in a food processor until homogenized, but not pasty
    2. Add the parmesan, olive oil, lemon juice, blitz again
    3. Toast the pine nuts in a frying pan until fragrant, then add to mixture
    4. Blitz again, but keep some chunky pine nuts
    5. Season

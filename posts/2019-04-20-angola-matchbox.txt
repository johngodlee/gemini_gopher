I got quite into finding different designs on matchboxes while in
Angola for fieldwork. Maybe it was the boredom of being in Lubango
for too long. Some of the designs are quite pretty, often reminding
me of old movie posters. Many of them also have flowers on them,
it’s just a shame that the names of the flowers aren’t also on the
matchboxes. Here is a selection of some of designs.
